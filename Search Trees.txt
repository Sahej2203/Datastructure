2 3 Trees
Multiway search trees , M-way search trees
Degree 3
B trees

All leaf nodes at same level.
Every node must have [n/2]=[3/2]=2 children

                k1 | k2
             l     m     n
 
           k1<k2

     l<k1  k1<m<k2   k2<n
2 3 trees grow upward.

keys:- 20,30,40,50,60,10,15,70,80,90

                  30|
            15|         50  |  70
         10|  20|    40|  60|   80|90

Deletion
Case 1 Simply delete
Case 2 Simple delete and merge
Case 3 Borrowing

Min nodes = 2^h+1 - 1
Max nodes = 3^h+1 -1/3-1

Min height = o(logn)
Max height = o(logn)

2 3 Trees are used in DBMS.We get multiple values and height is also less.

2-3-4 Trees
B-Tree of degree 4
Every node must have |4/2| = 2 children
All leaf at same level

keys:- 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,80,100,110

                  40
            20          60      80
       10      30     50  70  90  100

Red Black Trees
>It is a height balanced binary search tree,similar to 2-3-4 tree.
>Every node is either red or black.
>Root of a tree is always black.
>Nulls are also taken as black.
>Number of black from root to leaf are same.
>No 2 consecutive red nodes and children of red are black
>New inserted node is red.
>Height is logn<=h<=2logn

Binary tree n<h<logn
AVL logn<h<1.44logn

Creation
>Red Red Conflict 
 parent red uncle red - perform Recoloring
 parent red uncle black - perform Rotation
                          zig zig rotation RR/LR Rotation
                          zig zag rotation RL/LR Rotation

Red Black Trees are related to 2-3-4 Trees.
red key are part of that node.


Creating red black tree is similar to creating 2-3-4 trees.

Red Black trees deletion case
Case 1 Simply delete red node.
Case 2 Black node
       check sibling if sibling is red perform rotation
                     if sibling is black and children is red perform rotation
                     if sibling is black and children is black perform recolor
